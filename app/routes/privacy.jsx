          SEoS Assistant (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;the app&quot;) is operated by Aetrex Technology.
          This policy describes how SEoS Assistant processes data when a merchant
          installs it on a Shopify store, and how responsibility for that data is
          divided between the merchant, Shopify, and us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact:</strong>{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Roles: who is responsible for what</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The merchant is the data controller</strong> for all shopper and store data processed through the app. The merchant decides whether to install the app, whether and where the chat widget appears, which features and integrations are enabled, and what catalog, policy, and knowledge content the assistant uses. The app processes shopper data solely on the merchant&apos;s behalf and according to the merchant&apos;s configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Aetrex Technology acts as a data processor</strong> (a &quot;service provider&quot; under California law): we process personal information only to provide the app&apos;s services to the merchant, and not for our own purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Shopify</strong> provides the platform, authentication, checkout, and billing under its own <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy" rel="noreferrer">privacy policy</a> and terms. Orders, payments, and customer accounts live in Shopify, not in this app.</li>
          <li><strong>Shoppers&apos; privacy relationship is with the store they shop at.</strong> Shoppers should direct privacy questions and rights requests to the merchant, whose own privacy policy governs the storefront.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Merchant responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Because the merchant controls the storefront experience and the app&apos;s configuration, the following remain the merchant&apos;s sole responsibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining the storefront&apos;s own privacy policy and any legally required notices, including disclosure of the use of an AI chat assistant and automated processing, and any consent or cookie banners required in the merchant&apos;s jurisdictions.</li>
          <li>Establishing the lawful basis for processing shopper data on their storefront, and complying with the privacy, consumer-protection, accessibility, and marketing laws that apply to their store and customers.</li>
          <li>The accuracy and legality of all content the assistant is configured to communicate — product data, prices, claims, policies, knowledge files, and custom rules all come from the merchant&apos;s store and uploads.</li>
          <li>The third-party accounts the merchant connects. AI and integration API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI or Voyage AI, Klaviyo, Yotpo, Aftership) are the <strong>merchant&apos;s own accounts</strong>: data sent to those providers is processed under the merchant&apos;s own agreements with them, and enabling or disabling each integration is entirely in the merchant&apos;s control.</li>
          <li>Responding to shopper rights requests as controller. The app supports this automatically through Shopify&apos;s privacy webhook system (see §8) and the merchant&apos;s admin controls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data we process</h2>
        <p>When a merchant installs SEoS Assistant, we index and store the following from their Shopify store, on the merchant&apos;s instruction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Product catalog data (titles, descriptions, prices, variants, images, tags, metafields, product types), kept current via Shopify webhooks.</li>
          <li>Product attribute mappings configured by the merchant (metafield mappings and tag prefixes).</li>
          <li>Knowledge files uploaded by the merchant (FAQs, sizing guides, brand info, product specs, custom rules), and — when semantic retrieval is enabled — derived text chunks and numeric embedding vectors of that content.</li>
          <li>Merchant-provided third-party API keys — encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM, removable by the merchant at any time from Settings.</li>
          <li>Standard Shopify session records for the installing store. When a staff member uses the embedded admin, the session record may include that staff member&apos;s Shopify account name and email as provided by Shopify&apos;s authentication. The first name is used solely to personalize the in-admin greeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a shopper uses the chat widget on the storefront:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chat messages are processed transiently to generate AI responses. They are not stored in our database after the reply is delivered, except in the feedback case described below. Brief operational logs at our hosting provider may capture message fragments for debugging and abuse prevention and rotate automatically.</li>
          <li>We do not build shopper profiles and do not store shopper names, emails, or addresses. The one customer-linked record we keep is described below: when a chat-assisted session leads to an order, the order&apos;s Shopify customer ID is recorded for the merchant&apos;s conversion reporting.</li>
          <li>Anonymous usage metrics (message count, AI model used, token usage, cost, tool calls) are recorded per store for billing and analytics. Test conversations run by the merchant from the app&apos;s admin are flagged internal and are not recorded in analytics or counted against plan usage.</li>
          <li>If the shopper rates a response thumbs-up or thumbs-down, the conversation up to that point is stored alongside the rating so the merchant can review what the AI got right or wrong. The stored conversation is keyed only by a hashed source-IP identifier — not by customer ID, email, or any other identifier — and is automatically deleted after 90 days.</li>
          <li>When an order is attributed to a chat session, we record the order ID, order name, amount, currency, and the Shopify customer ID so the merchant&apos;s dashboard can report chat-driven revenue. The customer ID is removed automatically when Shopify sends a customer-redaction request, and all conversion records are deleted on store redaction or uninstall.</li>
          <li>If the merchant enables VIP Mode and the shopper is logged in, the assistant fetches the shopper&apos;s first name, order history, loyalty balance (Yotpo), and segment data (Klaviyo) per conversation to personalize replies. This data is used in-memory for the response and is not stored in our database.</li>
          <li>Shoppers should not enter sensitive personal information (such as health, financial, or government-ID details) into the chat. Messages are processed only to generate a reply and are not used for any other purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How we use data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Product catalog data is stored so the AI can search and recommend the merchant&apos;s products in real time.</li>
          <li>Chat messages are forwarded to the AI provider configured for the store to generate responses (see §5).</li>
          <li>When semantic search is enabled, product text and the shopper&apos;s search query are sent to the merchant&apos;s configured embedding provider to compute similarity vectors. Only the text needed for matching is sent; no shopper identity accompanies it.</li>
          <li>Knowledge files, attribute mappings, search rules, and category exclusions are included in the AI system prompt to improve answer quality and constrain results to the merchant&apos;s catalog.</li>
          <li>Usage data powers the merchant&apos;s analytics dashboard, plan limits, and billing.</li>
          <li>Customer email (when the shopper is logged in and VIP Mode is enabled) is used only server-side to look up loyalty and segment data from the merchant&apos;s Klaviyo and Yotpo accounts. It is not stored in our database and is not placed in the AI prompt.</li>
          <li>We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, and we do not use chat content to train AI models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Merchant-selected providers (the merchant&apos;s own accounts and agreements).</strong>{" "}
          The following providers are connected by the merchant with the merchant&apos;s own API keys.
          Data sent to them is processed under the merchant&apos;s direct agreement with each provider;
          we transmit it on the merchant&apos;s instruction and do not control those providers&apos; practices.
          Each integration can be disabled by the merchant at any time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude API)</strong> — chat messages are sent for AI processing under the merchant&apos;s API account. Per Anthropic&apos;s API terms, API content is not used to train models. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" rel="noreferrer">anthropic.com/privacy</a></li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI or Voyage AI (optional, embeddings)</strong> — product text and shopper search queries for semantic matching. <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" rel="noreferrer">openai.com/privacy</a> · <a href="https://www.voyageai.com/privacy" rel="noreferrer">voyageai.com/privacy</a></li>
          <li><strong>Klaviyo (optional)</strong> — shopper segment lookups for personalization. <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/privacy" rel="noreferrer">klaviyo.com/privacy</a></li>
          <li><strong>Yotpo (optional)</strong> — loyalty points, tier, and rewards lookups. <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/privacy-policy" rel="noreferrer">yotpo.com/privacy-policy</a></li>
          <li><strong>Aftership (optional)</strong> — tracking links route to the merchant&apos;s branded tracking page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Infrastructure we use to run the app:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Railway</strong> — application hosting and PostgreSQL database (AWS US region).</li>
          <li><strong>Shopify</strong> — platform, Admin API, App Bridge authentication, and billing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where personal data is transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to the United States, transfers rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission (and their UK and Swiss equivalents) or the receiving provider&apos;s equivalent recognized transfer mechanism.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
          For shopper data, the merchant is the controller and determines the lawful basis for processing on their storefront; we process on the merchant&apos;s documented instructions as embodied in the app&apos;s configuration. For the limited data we process for our own purposes (the merchant&apos;s account, billing, and service operation), we rely on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> — providing the app&apos;s services to the merchant who installed it.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — operating, securing, and improving the service (e.g. anonymous usage metrics, rate limiting, abuse prevention).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chat usage records are retained for the analytics period defined by the merchant&apos;s plan (7, 90, or 180 days).</li>
          <li>Product catalog data (including embeddings) is retained while the app is installed and updated in real time via Shopify webhooks.</li>
          <li>Knowledge files (and their derived chunks and embeddings) are retained until deleted by the merchant.</li>
          <li>Feedback data (including any conversation captured under §3) is automatically deleted after 90 days.</li>
          <li>Conversation history shown in the widget is stored in the shopper&apos;s browser (<code>localStorage</code>) and is not transmitted to our servers except as part of the per-message context window.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data deletion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When a merchant uninstalls SEoS Assistant, all associated data is automatically and permanently deleted from our database, including product data, embeddings, knowledge files, attribute mappings, search rules, chat usage records, feedback, conversion records, encrypted API keys, configuration, session records, and analytics. No request to us is required.</li>
          <li>We respond automatically to Shopify&apos;s mandatory privacy webhooks — customer data requests, customer redaction, and shop redaction — within the timelines Shopify requires.</li>
          <li>Merchants can delete individual knowledge files and clear encrypted API keys at any time from the admin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Data security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with a per-app key stored in our hosting environment.</li>
          <li>All communication between the widget, our server, Shopify, and third-party APIs uses HTTPS/TLS.</li>
          <li>Aside from the order-conversion record described in §3, no shopper-identifying record is stored in our database.</li>
          <li>Per-store and per-IP rate limiting protects merchants from abuse.</li>
          <li>Webhook payloads from Shopify are HMAC-verified, and admin requests are authenticated with Shopify session tokens, before processing.</li>
          <li>When a signed-in shopper asks about their own orders, their protected data (name, email, address, and order history) is accessed live from Shopify and used only to answer that request. It is not stored in our database, and each access is recorded in an internal access log that captures the event — never the underlying values.</li>
          <li>We maintain a written security incident-response policy, restrict production data access to authorized operators with 2FA, separate test and production data, and review these practices at least annually.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we do not warrant absolute security. If we become aware of a breach affecting personal data we process, we will notify Shopify and affected merchants without undue delay so they can meet their own notification obligations as controllers.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port personal data, to object to processing, and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. <strong>For shopper data, the merchant is the data controller</strong> — shoppers should direct requests to the store they shopped at, and we will assist the merchant in fulfilling them through Shopify&apos;s privacy webhook system. Merchants can contact{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a> about data we process for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>California (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> we act as a &quot;service provider&quot; — we process personal information only to provide the services described here, we do not sell or share personal information as those terms are defined under California law, and we do not retain, use, or disclose it for any purpose other than providing the services.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Regulatory frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          The app is designed to operate consistently with the processor / service-provider obligations of the EU and UK GDPR, the CCPA/CPRA and other US state privacy laws, and similar frameworks elsewhere: data minimization by default, automatic retention limits, automated honoring of Shopify&apos;s privacy webhooks, encryption of secrets at rest, and no secondary use of personal information. Obligations that attach to the storefront itself — privacy notices, consent, marketing rules, accessibility, sector-specific rules — apply to the merchant as controller and remain the merchant&apos;s responsibility (see §2). This page is provided for transparency and is not legal advice to merchants about their own compliance.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Children&apos;s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          SEoS Assistant is a business tool for Shopify merchants and is not directed at children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the chat, contact us and we will delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>13. AI-generated content disclaimer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chat responses are generated by artificial intelligence. While the assistant is designed to check its product claims against the merchant&apos;s live catalog before replying, AI output may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information, and is not guaranteed to be accurate, complete, or current.</li>
          <li>Authoritative prices, availability, promotions, shipping, and return terms are those shown at the merchant&apos;s checkout and on the merchant&apos;s official policy pages — not the chat.</li>
          <li>Product, sizing, and fit suggestions (including any comfort- or foot-health-related guidance) are general shopping assistance only. They are <strong>not medical advice</strong>, and are not a substitute for consultation with a qualified healthcare professional. Shoppers with medical conditions should consult a clinician before making health-related purchasing decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          The app is provided <strong>&quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot;</strong>, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law: (a) Aetrex Technology is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to the use of the app or its AI-generated content; (b) Aetrex Technology&apos;s total aggregate liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the app shall not exceed the amounts paid by the merchant to Aetrex Technology for the app in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim; and (c) the merchant assumes all responsibility for its use and configuration of the app, for the content the assistant is configured to communicate, and for the legal compliance of its own store, product claims, and policies. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions, so parts of this section may not apply to you. If any provision of this policy is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          SEoS Assistant does not set any cookies. The chat widget stores conversation history in the shopper&apos;s browser <code>localStorage</code>, which is cleared when the shopper clears their browser data or starts a new chat from the menu. The embedded admin relies on Shopify&apos;s own session mechanisms.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the &quot;Last updated&quot; date above; continued use of the app after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
